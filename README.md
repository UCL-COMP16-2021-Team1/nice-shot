# 3d-tennis-analysis

## Overview
**3D Tennis Analysis** is an open-source project which focuses on analysing tennis games with the help of computer vision. This project is a collaboration between Team 1 of UCL's 2021/22 COMP0016 module composed of Morgane Ohlig, Jin Feng and Prithvi Kohli and [InfoSys](https://www.infosys.com) as part of UCL's [Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/ucl-industry-exchange-network-ucl-ixn).

## Features
- Extraction of poses from videos with [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev);
- Recognition and classification of tennis shots with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) using the Convolutional Neural Network Model and the Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network;
- Reconstruction of poses with 3D skeletons in [Three.js](https://threejs.org).
