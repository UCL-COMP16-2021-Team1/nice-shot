    "# 3D Tennis Shot Recognition through Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks\n",

    "Using the method described in [Learning Three Dimensional Tennis Shots UsingGraph Convolutional Networks](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/21/6094) by M. Skublewska-Paszkowska, P. Powroznikand, E. Lukasi (2020).\n",

    "The paper mentions recording both the player and the racket to identify shots. It tested putting data into the ST-GCN with and without fuzzying of data, where fuzzying returned more accurate results.\n",
    "The input used is from the 3D skeleton videos from the [THETIS](http://thetis.image.ece.ntua.gr)(THree dimEnsional TennIs Shots human action dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ST-GCN is implemented with the [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/getting-started/) library."
